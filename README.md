# Building Energy Benchmarking and CO2 Emissions Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes CO2 emissions and energy consumption data for buildings in Seattle, using data collected in 2016. The goals are to provide an analysis of the current state of emissions and energy consumption, identify factors impacting CO2 emissions, and develop a predictive model for future emissions and energy consumption for buildings without existing measurements. A dashboard will be created for visualization and model interpretation.
